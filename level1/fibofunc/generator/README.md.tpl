# Fibo Count

The Fibonacci sequence is a list of numbers, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The Fibonacci numbers may be defined by the following recurrence relation:

```math
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
        f_0=0 \\
        f_1=1 \\
        f_i=f_{i-1}+f_{i-2}, \forall i \geq 2
    \end{cases}       
\end{equation}
```

You are given $`f_i=`$ {{fivalue}}.

Find *i*, index of the *i*-th term of the Fibonacci sequence that returns this number.
