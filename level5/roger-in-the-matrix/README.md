# Roger In The Matrix

Roger is an alien that travels the galaxy to find new life evidence. Finally, he landed on Earth and began the observation of its strange life form. He noticed that every life forms were spending time watching a rectangle with other life forms inside, doing many things. So he decided to also watch it in order to find the key of this life form. Through a window, he started watching the movie The Matrix and, at the end, felt completely upset and scared. What a complex life form! Immediatly after watching the movie, he sent a message to his planet, to reveal the key to understand us...

Roger uses audio waves to transmit data. Data is splitted into bunches of 4 bits, so it becomes an array of values from 0 to 15. To each value *n* is assigned a frequency *fn*, such as for *n in [0,15]*, *f0 < f1 < ... < f15*. Each value is repeated 128 times to be able to find out frequencies. The message can be of any formats: text, image, sound... It's up to you to figure out the right format, but it won't be the hardest part.

Given the transmitted data in the input file, find the key to the life form.
